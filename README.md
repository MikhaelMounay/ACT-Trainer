# Welcome to the ACT Trainer Platform
ACT Trainer is an initiative to help students, especially the ones with low financial capabilities, get their perfect ACT score from the first trial.

So far, the essential part of the platform is almost finished - The ACT Online Testing Platform (built to mimic the experience of [the official platform](https://cloud.e.act.org/cbt-for-international))

üî¥ *We are still working on adding tests to the platform from various sources on the internet.*
